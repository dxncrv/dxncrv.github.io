# react-portfolio

My first React project that isn't tutorials. This is a single page application (SPA) that uses the react framework, jsx syntax, js stores for content management, and tailwind css for styling.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the build since the article component logic parses whatever data type is added to the js store and formats it properly. Another component I'm proud about is the projects component, this was my first small win that made a significant difference in my confidence as a developer. I successfully made the tags populate from the tags string array in js store and made it so that each project can have multiple tags.

I still have a lot to critique about the issues with UX design, solution design and development build as a portfolio. So, this project is discontinued and will be replaced by a SvelteKit app.
